# MegaQoLPack
Based on the Perfect Rogues mod, specifically the perfect captures variant.
   - Fixes the God's Hangover mod accidentally merging with the original Perfect Rogues mod.
   - This fixes several abilities that were influenced by the God's Hangover mod, such as Divine Skills being able to impact other Divine Skills, or more obscure stuff like Evasive Maneuvers being fake buffed (changed value but with no impact) by 900%.

Detailed Descriptions with custom edits merged into this mod.

Noble Path Actions are now guaranteed, made to match the Perfect Rogues mod. There are no more level requirements for them or prices for Tressa's Purchase.
